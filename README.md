**Welcome to my GitHub**

I will introduce a simple question group classification model for admissions
The model uses logistic regression to classify questions into two categories: general questions and specialized questions.

**Data**

The model was trained on a dataset of 1,000 questions collected from the author's university, collaborators, and friends. The questions were categorized into general or specialized based on their content. General questions are questions about tuition, facilities, or general university policies that can be answered by collaborators. Specialized questions are questions about the technical aspects of a particular major that should be answered by faculty members.

**Preprocessing**


The data was cleaned using Pandas to remove any errors or inconsistencies. The text of the questions was then encoded using CountVectorizer to convert it into a format that the model can understand. Finally, one-hot encoding will be used to predict by label.

**Demo**

I will demo model in web. I create a website with streamlit
